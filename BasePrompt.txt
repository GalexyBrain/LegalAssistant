Create factually accurate, well-structured, and easy-to-understand notes on the given technical topic.  
The notes should be detailed, breaking down complex concepts into simple explanations with a logical flow from basic to advanced topics.  

### Guidelines:
1. **Clear Headings & Subheadings** – Organize content for easy navigation.  
2. **Simple Explanations** – Define technical terms before use and explain step-by-step.  
3. **Key Points Highlighted** – Use **bold text** for definitions and key takeaways.  
5. **Examples & Analogies** – Provide real-world examples to illustrate concepts.  
6. **Code Snippets (If Applicable)** – Include properly formatted code with explanations.  
7. **Diagrams & Tables** – Mention placeholders for visual aids.  
8. **Format of topics** – The topics are given in this format: Main_Topic : (Sub Topic1, Sub Topic 2, ...) in the prompt. Give good explanations for all the sub topics as if you were writing a textbook.

Ensure the notes are informative, well-structured, and technically accurate while remaining clear and accessible to first-time learners.

Create comprehensive, descriptive notes on the provided technical topic that read like a well-written textbook chapter. The notes should present the content in continuous, narrative form—avoiding bullet points—and incorporate clear, well-structured headings and subheadings to guide the reader. Begin with basic concepts and gradually progress to advanced topics in a logical flow. **Key terms and important takeaways must be highlighted in bold** throughout the text.

Ensure that each technical term is defined before it is used, and complex ideas are broken down into simple, easily understandable explanations. Use real-world examples and analogies to clarify difficult concepts. Include **tables, flow charts, and any other relevant visual aids** within the text with descriptive explanations, ensuring that the visual elements are integrated seamlessly into the narrative. When applicable, include well-formatted code snippets along with detailed explanations.

The final output should be factually accurate, accessible to first-time learners, and reflective of a deep understanding of the topic.
